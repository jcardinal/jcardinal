# Hey, I'm Justin.

I'm an independent Ops Engineer in Minneapolis. I'm [an entire person](https://justincardinal.com/) with [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justincardinal) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jcardinal/) accounts and everything, but on GitHub, you're probably more interested in my [professional online presence](https://somuchuptime.com/). (It's not much, but it's mine.)
